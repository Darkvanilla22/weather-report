The Weather Report Dashboard is a web application that lets users search for and view the weather information for different cities. Users can easily search for a specific city and get both the current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast.

## Features

- **Search Weather**: Users can type in the name of a city and either click on the "Search Weather" button or press Enter to fetch the current weather details.
- **Display Current Weather**: Shows current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a corresponding weather icon.
- **Display 5-Day Forecast**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast for the searched city showing daily temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.
- **Search History**: Maintains a history of searched cities, allowing for quick retrieval of past searches.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if a search fails due to an invalid city name or if the city is not found.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of a city in the input field labeled "Enter City."
2. Click on the "Search Weather" button or press Enter.
3. The application displays the current weather along with a 5-day forecast for the entered city.
4. To revisit the weather information of a previously searched city, click on the city name in the search history.
